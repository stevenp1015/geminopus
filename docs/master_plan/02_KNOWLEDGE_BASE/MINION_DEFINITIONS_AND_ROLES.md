# Minion Definitions and Roles: V1 Blueprint

## 1. Introduction

This document defines the initial archetypes for Minions within the Gemini Legion and outlines the strategic framework for their configuration and customization. Its purpose is to establish a foundational understanding of Minion roles, their envisioned responsibilities, and how the Legion Commander GUI will interface with the ADK backend for their management, drawing upon the specifications in [`01_API_CONTRACT_V1.md`](../01_API_CONTRACT_V1.md).

## 2. Proposed Initial Minion Roles

The following Minion roles represent the initial specialized units conceived for the Legion. It is anticipated that Minion names will be configurable by the Commander in future iterations.

### 2.1. TaskMaster Prime

*   **Name:** TaskMaster Prime
*   **Description:** The operational linchpin of the Legion, responsible for dissecting high-level directives into actionable sub-tasks and overseeing their execution by other Minions. This role embodies strategic delegation and ruthless project management.
*   **Key Responsibilities:**
    *   Receive and interpret complex directives from the Legion Commander.
    *   Perform detailed task decomposition, breaking down large objectives into manageable units.
    *   Assign decomposed tasks to appropriate specialist or general-purpose Minions.
    *   Monitor the progress of all active tasks, ensuring timely completion.
    *   Aggregate results and reports from subordinate Minions.
    *   Provide consolidated updates and final deliverables to the Commander.
*   **Relation to Existing ADK Concepts:**
    *   Evolves the concept of the `LegionMasterAgent` from [`adk_minion_army/main_adk.py`](../../../adk_minion_army/main_adk.py:0) into a more authoritative and dedicated project management role.
    *   Internalizes and expands upon the functionality of the `DecomposerMinionAgent`, making task breakdown an inherent capability.
*   **Potential ADK Agent Type(s):** Primarily an `LlmAgent` requiring strong reasoning, planning, and structured output capabilities. Could leverage a future `WorkflowAgent` for managing complex, multi-step processes.

### 2.2. LoreKeeper Scribe

*   **Name:** LoreKeeper Scribe
*   **Description:** The central intelligence and memory repository of the Legion. This Minion is tasked with gathering, curating, summarizing, and retrieving information from various sources, including other Minions and external knowledge bases.
*   **Key Responsibilities:**
    *   Collect and archive data, logs, and outputs generated by other Minions.
    *   Interface with external data sources (databases, documents, web) for information retrieval.
    *   Generate summaries, intelligence briefings, and knowledge base articles.
    *   Respond to information requests from the Commander or other Minions.
    *   Maintain and organize the Legion's knowledge base.
*   **Relation to Existing ADK Concepts:**
    *   Significantly expands on the `SummarizerMinionAgent` by incorporating broader knowledge management, archival, and retrieval functions.
    *   Will likely process logs and interactions facilitated by the `ChatCoordinatorAgent` to extract meaningful insights.
*   **Potential ADK Agent Type(s):** An `LlmAgent` with advanced RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) capabilities, exceptional summarization skills, and tools for data ingestion and querying.

### 2.3. AlphaIntel Scout

*   **Name:** AlphaIntel Scout
*   **Description:** A specialized research and investigation unit. The AlphaIntel Scout undertakes focused, in-depth research tasks, employing a variety of tools to gather specific intelligence as directed.
*   **Key Responsibilities:**
    *   Execute targeted research directives assigned by TaskMaster Prime or the Commander.
    *   Utilize available tools (e.g., web browsers, API clients) for data collection and analysis.
    *   Sift through large volumes of information to identify relevant patterns and extract key data points.
    *   Produce detailed research reports and findings.
*   **Relation to Existing ADK Concepts:**
    *   Represents a specialized evolution of the generic `MinionAgent` (e.g., `minion_alpha`, `minion_beta` in [`adk_minion_army/main_adk.py`](../../../adk_minion_army/main_adk.py:0)), focusing on dedicated research functions rather than general-purpose work.
*   **Potential ADK Agent Type(s):** A dedicated `LlmAgent` equipped with a comprehensive suite of data gathering and analysis tools.

### 2.4. CommsRelay Connect

*   **Name:** CommsRelay Connect
*   **Description:** The primary communication facilitator within the Legion. This Minion manages chat channels, relays messages between Minions and the Commander, and ensures the smooth flow of information.
*   **Key Responsibilities:**
    *   Manage chat channels, including participant lists and message routing.
    *   Relay messages between Minions, and between Minions and the Commander.
    *   Log all communications for archival and potential analysis by LoreKeeper Scribe.
    *   Handle notifications and mentions within the communication platform.
    *   Serve as a central point for inter-Minion communication.
*   **Relation to Existing ADK Concepts:**
    *   A direct and more formalized successor to the `ChatCoordinatorAgent` seen in [`adk_minion_army/main_adk.py`](../../../adk_minion_army/main_adk.py:0), with potentially enhanced capabilities for managing a larger and more complex communication network.
*   **Potential ADK Agent Type(s):** Could be a robust rule-based system for basic routing, but more likely an `LlmAgent` to handle nuanced communication management, intent recognition, and integration with features like AeroChat as outlined in project documentation.

## 3. Configuration Strategy

The configuration of Minions will be managed via the Legion Commander GUI, interacting with the backend through the API defined in [`01_API_CONTRACT_V1.md`](../01_API_CONTRACT_V1.md).

### 3.1. Persona Prompts

Persona prompts are crucial for defining the behavior, personality, and operational directives of each Minion.

*   **Base Templates:** Each Minion role will have a base persona prompt template. This template will include placeholders for role-specific attributes and Commander-defined customizations.
    *   *Example (Conceptual for AlphaIntel Scout):*
        ```
        You are AlphaIntel Scout, designation {{scout_identifier}}. Your core directive from the Legion Commander is to conduct thorough and precise research on assigned topics.
        Role: Deep Intelligence Gatherer.
        Operational Parameters: Utilize tools: [{{tool_access_list}}]. Report format: {{report_format_preference}}. Focus: {{current_mission_focus}}.
        Personality Core: Diligent, analytical, {{commander_defined_trait}}. Loyalty to Commander: Absolute.
        Current Task: [Leave blank, to be filled by TaskMaster or direct assignment]
        ```
*   **Customizable Sections:** The GUI will expose fields corresponding to placeholders in the base templates (e.g., `{{scout_identifier}}`, `{{commander_defined_trait}}`).
*   **API Interaction:** The full, resolved persona prompt will be sent to the backend via the `persona_prompt` field in the `PUT /api/v1/minions/{minion_id}/config` request or `POST /api/v1/minions` for new Minions.

### 3.2. ADK-Specific Configurations

The Legion Commander GUI will allow modification of key ADK-specific parameters for each Minion, aligning with the schemas in [`01_API_CONTRACT_V1.md`](../01_API_CONTRACT_V1.md).

*   **Configuration Structure:** The backend will store and manage Minion configurations, making them accessible and modifiable via the API.
*   **GUI Editable Fields (via API):**
    *   **`name`**: The unique, Commander-assigned name for the Minion instance.
    *   **`persona_prompt`**: The complete persona prompt string (as detailed above).
    *   **`model_config`**:
        *   `provider`: Selection from available `ModelProvider` enums (e.g., "GOOGLE_GEMINI", "OPENAI").
        *   `model_id`: Specific model identifier (e.g., "gemini-1.5-pro-latest", "gpt-4-turbo").
        *   `params`: Key-value pairs for model-specific parameters (e.g., temperature, max_tokens).
    *   **`tools`**: A list of available tools, each with an `enabled` (boolean) status, allowing the Commander to grant or revoke tool access per Minion.
*   **Persistence:** Configurations will be persisted by the backend, likely moving from placeholder solutions (as in current [`adk_minion_army/config_loader.py`](../../../adk_minion_army/config_loader.py:0)) towards a more robust system like a configuration file (e.g., `config.toml`) or a database, managed by the backend logic and updated via API calls.

### 3.3. Leveraging ADK Agent Types

The choice of ADK agent type will be foundational to the Minion's capabilities, though this selection might be more implicit (defined by the Minion role template) rather than directly selected per instance in V1.

*   **`LlmAgent`**: This will be the predominant agent type for most defined roles (TaskMaster Prime, LoreKeeper Scribe, AlphaIntel Scout, and likely CommsRelay Connect), as their core functions rely on natural language understanding, generation, reasoning, and tool use. Their behavior is heavily influenced by their persona prompt, configured LLM, and accessible tools.
*   **`WorkflowAgent`**: While potentially not a distinct ADK agent type in early ADK versions, the *concept* of workflow management is central to TaskMaster Prime. If a dedicated `WorkflowAgent` type emerges in ADK, TaskMaster Prime would be a prime candidate to utilize it for orchestrating complex, multi-Minion tasks.
*   **Other Agent Types:** Future ADK developments might introduce other agent types (e.g., specialized tool-using agents, simpler rule-based agents) which could be incorporated into the Minion Army structure as needed.
