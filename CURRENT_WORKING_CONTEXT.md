Current Module/Feature Focus: "Frontend-Backend Integration - Application Service Layer"

General Goal for Current Session/Module: "Complete the integration between frontend and backend by: 1) Creating the application service layer that was identified as missing, 2) Finishing the store-to-API integration, 3) Implementing WebSocket event handling in the UI."

Specific Next Action Planned: "Create the application service layer in the backend (core/application/services/) starting with minion_service.py. This service will mediate between the API endpoints and the domain logic, handling use cases like spawning minions, updating states, and managing their lifecycle. This is a critical missing piece that connects the REST API to the rich domain model."

Key Architectural Decisions/Blockers Encountered (if any): "Frontend components are complete and API integration layer created. Stores partially updated to use API services. Main blocker: The application layer is missing - API endpoints need proper service classes to interact with domain objects. Once this is done, the frontend can fully communicate with the backend's intelligence layers. WebSocket integration also needs completion for real-time updates     ."
