Current Module/Feature Focus: "API Layer - FastAPI Backend Setup"

General Goal for Current Session/Module: "Begin implementing the FastAPI backend to expose Minion capabilities via REST and WebSocket APIs. This will enable the React frontend to interact with the Legion."

Specific Next Action Planned: "Create the FastAPI application structure: 1) Set up main.py with FastAPI app initialization, 2) Implement basic REST endpoints for Minion management (spawn, list, send_message), 3) Add WebSocket support for real-time updates, 4) Create Pydantic schemas for API requests/responses. Start with a simple /minions endpoint to test the integration."

Key Architectural Decisions/Blockers Encountered (if any): "Memory system successfully integrated with MinionAgent and Factory! Full multi-layer memory now operational. Next priority: Expose this rich functionality via API so the GUI can interact with the Legion. Will use FastAPI for its excellent async support and automatic OpenAPI documentation."
