Current Module/Feature Focus: "Repository Implementations - Creating concrete in-memory repositories"

General Goal for Current Session/Module: "Implement concrete repository classes to support the application services. Starting with in-memory implementations that can be replaced with database implementations later. This will make the services fully functional for testing."

Specific Next Action Planned: "Create memory-based implementations for ChannelRepository, MessageRepository, MinionRepository, and TaskRepository in a new 'memory' subdirectory. These will store data in memory with async patterns matching the interfaces, ready for database replacement."

Key Architectural Decisions/Blockers Encountered (if any): "Application services are complete! All three services (MinionService, TaskService, ChannelService) are fully implemented with comprehensive functionality. They're waiting on repository implementations to actually persist data. Starting with in-memory implementations allows immediate testing while database layer is built out later. xoxo"
